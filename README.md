## Description
I created a generator for README.md files. 

By running the index.js, a user is prompted in their terminal to answer a few questions. These questions retrieve the following information: project title, a description, information about the installation process, how to use the project, how the project is licensed, who the contributors are, how to test the project, and how to contact the creator with questions.

To do this, I utilized node's file system, along with the inquirer. I utilized objects and functions. I used an outside source to create a badge for the chosen license. I utilized functions to remove the license section if no license was used. I used the file system to write a read me file, and I used template literals within the inserted information to add the user's input.

I was unable to utilize my gitignore properly as I didn't read that part of the README prior to adding the node modules. I plan to fix this ASAP.
